<p>tion technologies in the 21st-century. 5G is 

the next step beyond 4G and LTE mobile net-
works. It has faster speeds, high bandwidth 
and a wider range than the previous networks.
Educators have been always looking for ways 
to maximise the learning time of students. 
Technology helps teachers to make better 
connections with students and explore compli-
cated topics. But buffering videos and choppy 
applications can diminish the precious time 
available, limiting that time educators have to
actually teach. When it comes to the 5G, 
there are already plenty of applications in 
manufacturing, media, city management, and 
healthcare. Education is just scratching the 
surface of what’s possible in the classroom.
With the arrival of 5G, the teachers and educa-
tors can be able to expect a lot of new teaching 
experience and the student can be able to enjoy 
the new learning experience. Augmented real-
ity (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) which includes
mixed-reality content and video can help the 
students to give more immersive lessons. 
It helps the students to navigate through 
the human body or visit other planets.</p>

Setting up devices for a classroom and gather-
ing feedback in class is indeed a task for the 
tutors. It consumes so much time even when it 
works perfectly. With the Internet of Things (IoT) 
on 5G, teachers can automatically log in as
soon as they enter the classroom. Menial 
administrative tasks will be automated, 
and students can deliver feedback digitally.
Gen Z loves videos. Thus YouTube is also their 
preferred educational resource. According to 
NBC news, downloading a High Definition video 
may take only few seconds time when we use 
5G but with 4G, it can take minutes to an hour.
Some students with special needs may require 
full-time assistance from the teachers but they 
may not be available all the time. 5G will enable 
some robotic applications that act as full-time 
assistants and help the students with problem-
solving, become more responsive as they are 
designed.Every student has a different learn-</p>

ing style. 5G will help students continue their 
education outside the classroom by providing 
consistent data speeds and responsiveness.
Communication giants like Verizon are bring-
ing some of these use cases to life. In 2019, 
Verizon initiated a 5G Edtech Challenge to im-
prove the middle school education. This 5G Ed-
tech challenge recently awarded $1 million to
organisations and universities us-
ing AR, VR, among other technologies.
Though, 5G technology is researched and con-
ceptualised to solve all the hardships of the ed-
ucation sector, but because of economical rea-
sons and lack of technological advancements</p>
